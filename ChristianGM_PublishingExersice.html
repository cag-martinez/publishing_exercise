            This Ancient Roman “Dream Cherry” Gives You
            An <a style="color: red;">Extra 84 Minutes of Deep Sleep</a> Every Night
        </h1>
        <p><strong>PLUS: Over the age of 50? Watch below for the <u>scientifically verified solution</u> to your sleep problems…</strong></p>
        <p style="position: relative;">Hello. I’m <strong>Dr. Richard Gerhauser.</strong></p>
        <p>I’d like to ask you a question. And I apologize if it’s a bit personal…</p>
        <p>How are you sleeping these days?</p>
        <p>Meaning, when was the last time you woke up in the morning feeling truly… re-</p>
        <p>freshed?</p>
        <p>Like your batteries were completely recharged?</p>
        <p>And when’s the last time you sat up in bed, bright-eyed and bursting with en-</p>
        <p>ergy… </p>
        <p>…like waking up on the first day of summer vacation when you were a kid?</p>
        <p>How long since you’ve had that feeling?</p>
        <p>Has it been a while? A decade—or even more? </p>
        <p>Well, despite what you may think… it’s not your fault.</p>
        <p>I’m here to show you my scientifically verified way to reclaim that restful sleep </p>
        <p>(night after night)…</p>
        <p>AND boundless energy (day after day)…</p>
        <p>In fact, with what I’m about to show you… just days from now…</p>
        <p>You could start enjoying a full 84 minutes MORE deep, restful sleep every</p>
        <p> night.</p>
        <p>The fact is: If you’re like most of my patients over the age of 50…</p>
        <p>You’re not getting even close to the hours of quality sleep you used to.</p>
        <p>You go to bed, but you can’t fall asleep. </p>
        <p>Your mind keeps churning and nagging worries creep in… making it tough to </p>
        <p>drift off.</p>
        <p>And, when you do fall asleep, you can’t STAY asleep.</p>
        <p>Inevitably, you wake up… wide awake.</p>
        <p>Like your body is saying it’s time to get up. But it’s not… </p>
        <p>It’s still the middle of the night.</p>
        <p>Dawn is hours away… you feel drained, but you can’t fall back asleep…</p>
        <p>Or sometimes it’s your bladder… or frustrating aches and pains… that wake</p>
        <p>you up… make you toss and turn…</p>
        <p>And then it’s nearly impossible to get back to sleep… </p>
        <p>Whether it’s one of these problems or all of them… the results are the same.</p>
        <p>Every morning you feel drowsy, red-eyed… just plain exhausted.</p>
        <p>Sound all too familiar?</p>
        <!-- Here I will use a different line spacing for lines 55 to -->
        <p>As a doctor, I can assure you – what you’re experiencing isn’t something “you just have to live with at your age”…</p>
        <p>Because if you watch this presentation and try my method… we’ll finally be able to fix your sleep problems—FOR GOOD.</p>
        <p>It all happens by resetting your sleep cycle, 
            then your new, healthy sleep will be on auto-pilot</p>
        <p>You see, when you don’t sleep well—even for just one night—your body and brain aren’t able to “recharge”…</p>
        <p>So you barely have the energy to get through your daily routine, much less do the fun, social activities you used to enjoy…
        </p>
        <p>Sure, you might be able to squeak by that way… but, be honest, does it feel</p>
        <p>good?</p>
        <p>Or even normal?</p>
        <p>Maybe you’ve even tried sleep aids before – and found they don’t really work?</p>
