        </h1>
        <p><strong>PLUS: Over the age of 50? Watch below for the <u>scientifically verified solution</u> to your sleep problems…</strong></p>
        <p style="position: relative;">Hello. I’m <strong>Dr. Richard Gerhauser.</strong></p>
        <p>I’d like to ask you a question. And I apologize if it’s a bit personal…</p>
        <p>How are you sleeping these days?</p>
        <p>Meaning, when was the last time you woke up in the morning feeling truly… re-</p>
        <p>freshed?</p>
        <p>Like your batteries were completely recharged?</p>
        <p>And when’s the last time you sat up in bed, bright-eyed and bursting with en-</p>
        <p>ergy… </p>
        <p>…like waking up on the first day of summer vacation when you were a kid?</p>
        <p>How long since you’ve had that feeling?</p>
        <p>Has it been a while? A decade—or even more? </p>
        <p>Well, despite what you may think… it’s not your fault.</p>
        <p>I’m here to show you my scientifically verified way to reclaim that restful sleep </p>
        <!-- Page #2 -->
        <p>(night after night)…</p>
        <p>AND boundless energy (day after day)…</p>
        <p>In fact, with what I’m about to show you… just days from now…</p>
        <p>You could start enjoying a full 84 minutes MORE deep, restful sleep every</p>
        <p> night.</p>
        <p>The fact is: If you’re like most of my patients over the age of 50…</p>
        <p>You’re not getting even close to the hours of quality sleep you used to.</p>
        <p>You go to bed, but you can’t fall asleep. </p>
        <p>Your mind keeps churning and nagging worries creep in… making it tough to </p>
        <p>drift off.</p>
        <p>And, when you do fall asleep, you can’t STAY asleep.</p>
        <p>Inevitably, you wake up… wide awake.</p>
        <p>Like your body is saying it’s time to get up. But it’s not… </p>
        <p>It’s still the middle of the night.</p>
        <p>Dawn is hours away… you feel drained, but you can’t fall back asleep…</p>
        <p>Or sometimes it’s your bladder… or frustrating aches and pains… that wake</p>
        <p>you up… make you toss and turn…</p>
        <p>And then it’s nearly impossible to get back to sleep… </p>
        <p>Whether it’s one of these problems or all of them… the results are the same.</p>
        <p>Every morning you feel drowsy, red-eyed… just plain exhausted.</p>
        <!-- Page #3 -->
        <p>Sound all too familiar?</p>
        <!-- Here I will use a different line spacing for lines 55 to 61 -->
        <p>As a doctor, I can assure you – what you’re experiencing isn’t something “you just have to live with at your age”…</p>
        <p>Because if you watch this presentation and try my method… we’ll finally be able to fix your sleep problems—FOR GOOD.</p>
        <p>It all happens by resetting your sleep cycle, 
            then your new, healthy sleep will be on auto-pilot</p>
        <p>You see, when you don’t sleep well—even for just one night—your body and brain aren’t able to “recharge”…</p>
        <p>So you barely have the energy to get through your daily routine, much less do the fun, social activities you used to enjoy…
        </p>
        <p>Sure, you might be able to squeak by that way… but, be honest, does it feel</p>
        <p>good?</p>
        <p>Or even normal?</p>
        <p>Maybe you’ve even tried sleep aids before – and found they don’t really work?</p>
        <p>I’m not surprised. </p>
        <!-- Single spacing -->
        <p>They never actually get to the root of your problems… so they’re a complete waste of money.</p>
        <p>Here’s the truth I’ve been telling my senior patients for more than 20 years now:</p>
        <p>The reason sleep aids don’t work is because…</p>
        <p>There are 3 separate issues affecting seniors 
            and making it near impossible for you to get deep “recharging” sleep…</p>
        <p>I call them the 3 Sleep Stealers.</p>
        <p>Before we get started, let’s identify how many you might have now…</p>
        <!-- Page #4 -->
        <p>Sleep Stealer #1: When you go to bed, does your “racing” mind keep you from falling asleep quickly?</p>
        <!-- Apacing and three lines -->
        <p>I know that feeling too, and I’m about to show you a special technique that works like a “light dimmer” to gently calm your brain and help you fall asleep in HALF the time.</p>
        <p>Sleep Stealer #2: Has your body STOPPED “making sleep”?</p>
        <p>That may sound a little weird, but keep watching and I’ll show you a quick way</p>
        <p>to check. </p>
        <p>After all, if you often find yourself awake during the night…</p>
        <p>Or wake up far too early in the morning…</p>
        <p>Then your body may have stopped “making sleep.” </p>
        <p>It happens to a lot of people as they get older.</p>
        <p>Luckily, there’s an easy way to fix it. I’ll explain everything in a moment.</p>
        <p>But first… </p>
        <!-- Single spacing line 89 and 90 -->
        <p>Sleep Stealer #3: Do you have any nighttime annoyances, like getting up to pee or pain that keeps you awake?</p>
        <p>This is the BIGGEST complaint I hear from my patients, but luckily the solution to keeping the pesky wake-up calls at bay is so simple…</p>
        <p>Maybe all 3 of these “Sleep Stealers” sound familiar?</p>
        <p>These issues are the real reason why you have such trouble sleeping…</p>
        <!-- Single spacing -->
        <p>And that’s what makes my solution different than anything else you might’ve tried before.</p>
        <p>I’m about to share with you the same thing I tell my patients…</p>
        <!-- Page #5 -->
        <p>We can solve your sleep problem together.</p>
        <p>Right now… for the first time ever, 
            I’m giving you my method to defeat all 3 Sleep Stealers…</p>
        <p>Right here in this presentation.</p>
        <p>All you need to do is naturally “reset your sleep cycle”…</p>
        <p>And if you follow the few steps I’m about to show you… it’ll be like trading in your current frustrating, unsatisfying sleep…</p>
        <p>For the deep, restful sleep you remember from your teenage years. </p>
        <p>That’s not a promise, it’s a GUARANTEE.</p>
        <p>Let me explain.</p>
        <p>I’m talking about a new, non-drug solution for your sleep problems.</p>
        <p>Just do the 3 simple steps in this video and I guarantee you will…</p>
        <p>Fall asleep in half the time…</p>
        <p>Spend more hours every night in restful REM or “deep sleep”…</p>
        <p>And dramatically decrease how often you wake up overnight to use the restroom or because of aches and pains…</p>
        <p>In fact, these 3 simple steps are so powerful, they’re…</p>
        <p>…scientifically verified to give an EXTRA 84 minutes of sleep every night.</p>
        <p>Let me repeat that… follow these 3 scientifically verified steps…</p>
        <p>And you’ll enjoy almost an hour and a half MORE sleep every single night.</p>
        <p>That’s like 10 BONUS hours of deep, restful sleep every week…</p>
        <!-- Page #6 -->
        <p>Friend, if you’re struggling with one, two, or all three of the “Sleep Stealers”… THIS is a life-saver. </p>
        <p>The truth is, </p>
        <!-- Bold and single spacing -->
        <p>I see almost no bigger change in quality of life and health for seniors than when they follow my 3-step protocol and reset their sleep cycle</p>
        <p>And when you do it yourself… pretty soon, you’ll have your own moment.</p>
        <p>Picture this…</p>
        <p>You’re getting ready for bed.</p>    
        <p>You slip under the blankets, switch off the light… and close your eyes. </p>
        <p>Your mind is calm. You’re not worried or anxious…</p>
        <p>You feel at peace.</p>
        <p>In just a few minutes you drift off to sleep… without a care in the world…</p>
        <p>Then… before you know it… you open your eyes. </p>
        <p>You blink in the morning sun streaming through your windows.</p>
        <p>You suddenly realize: You slept straight through the night.</p>
        <!-- Single space -->
        <p>You didn’t get up to use the restroom… you didn’t wake up because of aching joints or a sore back…</p>
        <p>In fact,</p>
        <p>You just experienced the deepest, most refreshing night’s sleep you can remember…</p>
        <p>So you swing your legs over the side of the bed… eager to start your day.</p>
        <p>You’re full of energy. Your mind is crystal clear.</p>
        <!-- Page #7-->
        <p>Heck, you might just skip your usual morning coffee and plunge right into your</p>
        <p>day.</p>
        <p>You can’t believe how great… how YOUNG… you feel.</p>
        <p>Just imagine if you felt that way every morning from now on.</p>
        <p>You can. </p>
        <p>And I guarantee it.</p>
        <p>All you need to do is “reset your sleep cycle” in 3 easy steps…</p>
        <p>So let’s get started right now.</p>
        <!-- Single spacing -->
        <p>And don’t worry about memorizing this or taking notes. At the end of this presentation I’ll make the full protocol available for you…</p>
        <p>Ok, let’s jump right in with Step 1:</p>
        <!-- Thinking about breaking this <p> into three different tags and giving them the same class with different ID 
            to help style better -->
        <p>How to get 10 EXTRA hours of sleep every week thanks to my best sleep secret:
            An Ancient Roman cherry </p>
        <p>It’s shown to give you an extra 84 minutes of deep, restful sleep every night.</p>
        <p>Ever heard of the Roman Dream Cherry?</p>
        <p>Here’s a picture.</p>
        <!-- Insert image here -->
        <img></img>
        <p>They look a lot like the “normal” cherries we’re used to seeing in the supermar-</p>
        <p>ket, don’t they? </p>
        <!-- Page #8-->
        <p>Actually, what you’re seeing is a very rare and special kind of cherry. </p>
        <p>It’s an exotic fruit that goes all the way back to ancient Rome.</p>
        <!-- single spacing, maybe break into two elements with same class different ID for line 161, 162, 165 -->
        <p>And science has FINALLY caught on… the ancient Dream Cherry is a God-send for seniors who have trouble sleeping…</p>
        <p>Just listen to this: Recently, a study was conducted on a small group of seniors with serious sleeping challenges…</p>
        <p>Some of the volunteers drank a cup of Dream Cherry juice every day…</p>
        <p>The rest of the volunteers were given a placebo.</p>
        <p>After just 14 days, all of the volunteers were tested using something called a polysomnographic sleep study. (That’s just a fancy sleep monitoring system.)</p>
        <p>That way, they could accurately test if Dream Cherry helped people sleep bet-</p>
        <p>ter.</p>
        <p>And when they got the results, the scientists couldn’t believe their eyes.</p>
        <p></p>
